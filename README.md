# flatmate




## Inspiration
**Finding a flatmate is hard!** 
Either if you have a room to rent out, or if you are searching for one to live in. And, most important, you need to click with your potential flatmate!  Most of us had that one weird flatmate that gave you the chills everytime you thought of going home...

We wanted to streamline this process by introducing a matching algorythm that compares rooms and searching criteria and facebook provided data from potential flatmates. No more scrolling through an endless list of flats and no more spam from the approximatly 200+ people who are interessted in the room you are renting out.


## What it does
flatmate has two main views. One for the people who are searching flats and one for those who are renting out a room/ flat. 

If you search a flat your searching criteria, things like room size, max price and so on,  is matched against the available rooms. Then we check the facebook data of the potential landlords. This way we show you only the landlords you will propably like.

## How we built it
Patrick did the IOS frontend. Viktor and Adrian built the backend together. Marcel provided *b-e-a-utiful* desings and Marcel was the business guy!

## Challenges we ran into
Computer crashes, "but-it-works-on-my-machine-bugs", weird stuff and more

## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned


## What's next for Flatmate
Optimize the matching algorythm and the implementation of the landlords view.
